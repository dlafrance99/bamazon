# bamazon

Problem: 

This app is designed as a mock storefront. It will allow the customer to purchase an item, assuming there is enough in stock and will give the customer their total. The manager will have access to view all products, products with low inventory, add to their inventory, and add new products. It will also allow the supervisor to sort the data into departments, as well as check final profits. 

Organization:

This app is organzied into only a few different files. Below is a quick description.

.gitignore: This tells github what to ignore, which includes node_modules.

bamazonCustomer.js: This is the main javascript file, which contains all the functionality of the app. 

package-lock.json: This stores all of the npm install requirements.

Instructions: 

In order to use this app, the user must launch the node app, then follow the inquirer prompts, to select the functions that they would like to complete.
